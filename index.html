<p> I am attending the Economics Observatory Data Masterclass in Newport, on Thursday 22 February. </p>

            <h2>Section 1: A basic chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                We've organised the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description. Here, we can describe the chart and give some context.
                As a first example, we're using the basic chart from the previous session.
            </p>

        <figure id="Location1"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
    </section>

     <script>

        var figure_1_spec = "inflation_decomposition.json"; // We're storing the URL of the graph we want to display in a variable

        vegaEmbed('#Location1', figure_1_spec) // We're using the vegaEmbed function to put a graph in the element with id figure_1
